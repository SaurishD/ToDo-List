# ToDo-List
A webapp that maintains your Task and subtask for each task per user basis. It uses angular as frontend and ExpressJS and MongoDb in backend

To deploy on local machine, go to the AngularFrontend folder and run the angular project with following command:
>ng serve -o

Open ExpressJSserver and run the server by following command
>npm start

You should have MongoDB running in your system on default port.

ExpressJS server is running on port 2500. To change the port you have to change port variable in the index.js file of ExpressJS module and change URL in the Angular module.
